## Lab Tasks

### Lab Experiments on Object Oriented Analysis & Design
- **Lab Assignment 1: [Write a Java Program demonstrating multiple interface/inheritance. You are free to choose the application for demonstrating multiple interface/inheritance.](https://github.com/ahnafshahrear/Object-Oriented-Design-And-Design-Patterns-Lab/tree/main/Example%20of%20Java%20Multiple%20Inheritance) ✓**
- **Lab Assignment 2: [Write a Java program to demonstrate a Pet Management System - which can be a pet shop, pet care or pet service. You have to follow appropriate object oriented design concepts to implement the tasks.](https://github.com/ahnafshahrear/Animal-Hospital-Management-System) ✓**

### Lab Experiments on Design Pattern
