### Description
- **The Vending Machine has three states: `IdleState`, `HasOneDollarState` and `OutOfStockState`. The VendingMachine class manages these states and handles actions like inserting a dollar, ejecting money & dispensing products. The vending machine initializes with a given product count and transitions between states based on user interactions. The Main class demonstrates the vending machine's functionality by simulating various user actions and displaying the current state and remaining product count.**
